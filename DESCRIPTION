Description: Scrap stock price data for Yahoo! Finance
    (\url{https://finance.yahoo.co.jp/}).
    By specifying multiple brand codes,
    you can get stock price data of multiple companies with just one function.
    There is also a function that 
    allows you to search for a brand code
    from a company name using JPX's public data,
    so by specifying multiple company names,
    you can obtain stock price data for multiple companies with just one function. 
    Web scraping uses the functions of the {rvest} package.
